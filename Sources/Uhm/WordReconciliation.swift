    ///
    /// - **Word fully inside filler** → drop the word. Whisper transcribed
    ///   the filler as a real word.
    /// - **Word leaks into filler from before** → trim the word's end to
    ///   `filler.start`.
    /// - **Word leaks out of filler to after** → push the word's start to
    ///   `filler.end`.
    /// - **Word strictly contains the filler** → split into pre- and
    ///   post-filler ranges; emit the longer half (or both, per
    ///   `options.splitContainedWords`).
    /// - **No overlap** → word passes through unchanged.
    ///
    /// Multiple fillers overlapping a single word are applied sequentially,
    /// so a word can split into many pieces if it spans multiple fillers
    /// (with `splitContainedWords = true`).
    ///
    /// The `minOverlapFraction` option gates each rule: an overlap below
    /// the threshold (vs the current word piece's duration) is ignored,
    /// so small ASR-vs-Uhm boundary jitter doesn't trim real words.

    /// Output is sorted by `start` and filtered of zero/negative durations.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - words:   ASR word ranges. Need not be sorted.
